This Wiki covers the post install setup for a BioIT server based on CentOS 7. Install the initial CentOS 7 server with just the base packages and then follow the instructions in this wiki to install a remote desktop and bioinformatics tools, as well as maintain up to date versions and add new tools to the platform.
