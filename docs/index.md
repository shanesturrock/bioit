## Documentation for setting up a BioIT server.

This Wiki covers the post install setup for a BioIT server based on CentOS 7. Install the initial CentOS 7 server with just the base packages and then follow the instructions in this wiki to install a remote desktop and bioinformatics tools, as well as maintain up to date versions and add new tools to the platform.

To avoid using root, a build user will be created and the github repository and wiki should be checked out into that user. The `/opt/bioit` location will also be owned by build. 

Start at the [Installation](Installation) page.
