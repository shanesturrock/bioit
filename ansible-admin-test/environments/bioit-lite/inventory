[bioit-login-hosts]
# These are the only hosts that end-users can log in to, if the
# host isn't in here then their account will be set to /sbin/nologin
# even when set to /bin/bash in the users.yml
#
# Admin users should be in group_vars/all/users.yml so this rule doesn't
# apply to them and can log into any host

[other-vms]
# Random other VMs for testing, builds, etc
# They won't have slurm or end-user logins permitted, but will have other common
# setup (NFS mounts, user/groups created)

[nfsserver]
# This is a VM but exports NFS, so we're more careful what tasks get run here
# Currently just user/group account created for quota application on NFS exports
silver

[nfs-clients]
# Other VMs mount storage off the server
