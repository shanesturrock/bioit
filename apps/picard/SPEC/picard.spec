* Wed Jul 26 2017 Shane Sturrock <shane.sturrock@gmail.com> - 2.10.4-1
- This Picard version contains MAJOR CHANGES TO DEFAULT SETTINGS that impact
  throughput of pipelines.
- New features
  - MAJOR CHANGE: The default compression level is now 1 instead of 5 for
    faster reading (#843). The tradeoff in increased size is paid for by the
    ~3x faster reading.
  - MAJOR CHANGE: Picard now uses the Intel Deflator and Inflator instead of
    JDK for writing and reading compressed data (#843, DSDEGP-454). The Intel
    library is faster in tests than the older JDK library. To disable the Intel
    library and revert to using the JDK library, specify USE_JDK_DEFLATER and
    USE_JDK_INFLATER Boolean arguments.
- Bug fixes
  - Htsjdk versioning is now fixed and cannot be transitive (#843). Previously,
    a dependency could pull in a different version of htsjdk and overwrite the
    build's htsjdk version. Now, the version shown in the build.gradle file is 
    the htsjdk version used by all tools. Currently, Picard uses htsjdk v2.10.1.

* Wed Jul 19 2017 Shane Sturrock <shane.sturrock@gmail.com> - 2.10.3-1
- Add warning to CheckIlluminaDir if we detect cycles without data. (#874)

* Fri Jul 14 2017 Shane Sturrock <shane.sturrock@gmail.com> - 2.10.2-1
- yet another reverse-compatibility issue in CrosscheckReadgroupFingerprints
  (#868) 
- fixed bug in Liftover pertaining to indels that straddle two "linksâ€¦
  (#864)

* Thu Jul 13 2017 Shane Sturrock <shane.sturrock@gmail.com> - 2.10.1-1
- Bug fix
  - Fix RevertSam to SANITIZE output when read group information is missing
    (#856). The tool considers read group (RG) information missing if the SAM
    file header does not have an @RG line, the read does not have an RG tag or 
    the tag's read group is absent from header groups.
  - For deprecated CrosscheckReadGroupFingerprints, fix option
    EXPECT_ALL_READ_GROUPS_TO_MATCH (#860).
- New feature
  - Fingerprinting tools now read a HaplotypeMap object from a VCF (#793).
    Previously, tools could only read a custom-formatted file. The VCF needs to
    have exactly one sample, HET for all the variants, and haplotype block 
    phasing via phased genotypes (0|1, and 1|0) and the PS format field. The 
    AF field is the AlternateAllele frequency, NOT the minor allele frequency, 
    as it is in the HaplotypeDatabase file. For more details on the file 
    formats, see GATK Article#9526.
